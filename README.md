Horiseon Website - Code Refactor Homework

For this assignment, I was required to assume the position of a junior developer who must refactor code for a digital marketing company. The code I was given needed to be revised to improve accessibility and search engine functions. To accomplish this, I added alt attributes to each image in the website. I added a descriptive title. I also replaced generic div elements with semantic html elements and made the corresponding changes in the css file. Lastly, I cleaned up the code, adding spaces and comments to improve comprehension, as well as fixing broken links. The end product is a fully functional website that fulfills accessibility standards and optimizes search engine functions.
